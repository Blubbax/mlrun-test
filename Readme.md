# MLRun test

This repository was created during my Master's Thesis and aims to evaluate the usage of MLRun as an MLOps platform. This project is rather small. Its aim is to test the usability of this tool to be able to decide if this tool should be used. Further functionalities of ClearML are described in the documentation.

A local MLRun environment was set up with the included docker compose script.
